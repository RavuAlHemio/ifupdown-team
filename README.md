# team support for ifupdown

This set of scripts attempts to introduce support for the `team` driver in
Debianâ€™s `ifupdown` suite. `team` is considered by some to be the spiritual
successor of the `bonding` driver.

The `bonding` driver is already supported by `ifupdown` (primarily by the
scripts in the `ifenslave` package).
